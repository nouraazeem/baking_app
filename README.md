                          WELCOME! The Sweet Road Baking Web App

This is my baking app where I am going to build an RShiny app to:
1. Store my recipes that I have made and are yummy
2. To help me choose new recipes based on recipes I have made before (also allowing others to add in their recipes)

To do this I am going to collect the following pieces of information:
1. Name of the recipe + recipe submitter + date recipe was submitted
2. Ingredients of the recipe + amounts of the ingredients
3. the steps of the recipe itself

Users of the app can narrow down available recipes by the following option: recipe type, sweetness scale (how sweet the recipe is), ingredients indicator (the ingredients to anrrow down from), recipe contributor (who submitted the recipe)
